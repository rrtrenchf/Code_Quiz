# Code Quiz Homework
- Created HTML with classes and IDs to communicate with the DOM
- created javascript and named variables based on my HTML
- created and object with an array of quiz questions
- Made a timer that begins when the start quiz button is clicked
- Made a function called 'start game' and connected it to an event listener
- Created a for loop that looped through the array of choices, added points, deducted time, and/or ended the game or moved on the next quesiton.
## Things I couldn't get working
- Couldn't get local storage, a score board or a highscore page to work.
